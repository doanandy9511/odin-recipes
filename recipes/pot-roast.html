            <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika - optional</li>
            <li>1 pound baby red potatoes</li>
            <li>4 large carrots - chopped into large chunks</li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion - chopped</li>
            <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons corn starch</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Turn on your instant pot and set it to "saute". 
                In a small bowl stir together salt, pepper, garlic 
                powder, onion powder, and smoked paprika. Rub 
                mixture all over the roast to coat all sides. </li>
            <li>Drizzle oil in instant pot, wait about 30 seconds, 
                then use tongs to place roast in the pot. Do not 
                move it for 3-4 minutes until well-seared and 
                browned. Use tongs to turn the roast onto another 
                side for 3-4 minutes, repeating until all sides 
                are browned.</li>
            <li>Switch instant pot to “pressure cook” on high and 
                set to 60-80 minutes (60 for a 3 pound roast, 80 
                for a 5 pound roast. see notes if using baby 
                carrots). Add potatoes, onions, and carrots to 
                pot (just arrange them around the roast) and pour 
                beef broth and worcestershire sauce over 
                everything. Place lid on the pot and turn to 
                locked position. Make sure the vent is set to the 
                sealed position.</li>
            <li>When the cooking time is up, do a natural release 
                for 10 minutes (don't touch anything on the pot, 
                just let it de-pressurize on its own for 10 
                minutes). After 10 minutes, turn vent to the 
                venting release position and allow all of the 
                steam to vent and the float valve to drop down 
                before removing the lid. </li>
            <li>Transfer the roast, potatoes, onions, and carrots 
                to a platter and shred the roast with 2 forks into 
                chunks. Use a handheld strainer to scoop out bits 
                from the broth in the pot. Set instant pot to 
                "soup" setting. Whisk together the water and corn 
                starch. Once broth is boiling, stir in corn starch 
                mixture until the gravy thickens. Add salt, pepper, 
                and garlic powder to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve gravy poured over roast and veggies and 
                garnish with fresh thyme or parsley if desired.</li>
        </ol>
