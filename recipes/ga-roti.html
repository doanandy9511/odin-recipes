        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Vietnamese roasted chicken (Ga Roti) is aromatic, tender, soy-marinated chicken,
            usually served with steamed rice, lettuce, and picked vegetables.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Chicken</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 chicken leg quarters</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons Maggi Seasoning</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sea salt for seasoning and 1 tablespoon sea salt for cleaning</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Chinese Five Spice Powder</li>
            <li>1 shallot (peel and mince)</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves (peel and mince)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Salt / Vinegar Mixture</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons white or rice vinegar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Clean the chicken by scrubbing it with 1 
                tablespoon salt. This helps get rid of any foul 
                poultry smell and surface residue. Rinse the 
                chicken under cold running water to wash off salt 
                then drain dry.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine Maggi Seasoning, 
                sugar, remaining salt (1 teaspoon), five-spice 
                seasoning powder, shallot, garlic, and ginger. 
                Add chicken and marinate for at least 30 minutes 
                or overnight in the fridge for tastier results.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425Â°F. Line a large baking sheet 
                with foil or parchment paper to reduce cleanup 
                then place a wire rack on top. Lay chicken skin 
                side down with spacing in between and bake for 
                30 minutes. Flip and repeat for additional 30 
                minutes.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together salt and vinegar. 
                Using a pastry brush, slather the mixture on the 
                skin of the chicken. Continue to bake for 10-15 
                more minutes until golden brown.</li>
        </ol>
