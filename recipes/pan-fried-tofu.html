        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A simple to make everyday dish that originates from Hong Kong
            It pairs nicely with soy sauce and rice.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) package extra-firm tofu</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped green onions</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place tofu onto a plate and place another plate 
                on top. Set a 3 to 5 pound weight on top. Press 
                tofu for 20 to 30 minutes; drain and discard the 
                accumulated liquid.</li>
            <li>Cut tofu into 2x4-inch strips about 1/4-inch thick.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large skillet over 
                medium-low heat. Cook tofu strips in the oil until
                golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Stack tofu 
                strips horizontally in a dish with sloping sides, 
                like a teacup saucer.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the same skillet. 
                Add green onions; cook and stir until fragrant, 
                10 to 20 seconds. Spoon green onions over tofu 
                while they are still sizzling. Coat with soy sauce. 
                Let sit until tofu soaks up flavors, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
